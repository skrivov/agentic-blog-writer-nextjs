At birth, he was given the name Red by his parents, who lived in a quiet nest on Bird Island. Even as a hatchling, his feathers were a deeper crimson than those of his kin, and his temper flared like a wildfire. While the other birds chirped and played, Red often found himself bristling at the smallest annoyances, his fury a force of nature unto itself.

As he grew, the village elder, Matilda, sought to temper his rage, teaching him the ways of focus and control. But Red's wrath was not without purposeâ€”when the green pigs came to steal the sacred eggs, it was his fiery determination that led the birds into battle. With a heart ablaze and an unstoppable will, he became known across the land as Angry Bird, the unyielding defender of his home.
